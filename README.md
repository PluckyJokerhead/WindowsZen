# **Windows Zen**

Windows Zen's aim is to allow users to easily make Windows 10 more like Windows 7 - by changing the sounds, adding a more functional Start Menu ([Classic Shell](https://sourceforge.net/projects/classicshell/?source=directory)) etc. It was created because every time I install Windows 10 I go through a process of installing Classic Shell, disabling telemetry, and applying a lot of other tweaks to make my experience more enjoyable; to make this process simpler I thought I'd make a program to do it for me.

## Current intended tweaks:
* Classic Shell installation, with my preferred theme & settings (looks like a more modern Windows 7, black by default)
* Disabling of Windows 10's telemetry. If you're serious about that stuff you might want to use [DisableWinTracking](https://github.com/10se1ucgo/DisableWinTracking) as well.
* Windows 7 Sounds. Who doesn't love that 'duDU' when you plug your phone in? I'm not sure what the rules are on distributing old Windows sounds, so this may have to be removed in the future. It's probably fine though.
* Not sure what else, feel free to suggest stuff.
